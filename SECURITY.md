## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please create Issue.

All security vulnerabilities will be promptly verified and addressed.

While the discovery of new vulnerabilities is rare, we also recommend always using
the latest versions of Bot and other dependencies by maintaining lock files (`package-lock.json`) in order
to ensure your application remains as secure as possible.
